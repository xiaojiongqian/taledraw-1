6. **State Persistence Tests** (`state/state-persistence.test.js`)
   - Complete state saving/restoration
   - 24-hour expiration handling
   - Version compatibility
   - Data sanitization
   - Cross-session management
   - Storage quota handling
   - Security (no sensitive data saved)

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- Added 6 new major test suites covering all PRD requirements
- Each test suite includes edge cases and error scenarios
- Tests cover both happy paths and failure scenarios

### 2. **Better Test Organization**
- Tests organized by feature domain in separate directories
- Clear naming conventions for test files
- Logical grouping of related tests using describe blocks

### 3. **Enhanced Test Quality**
- Proper mocking of external dependencies (Firebase, APIs)
- Async operation handling with proper waitFor patterns
- User interaction simulation with userEvent
- Comprehensive assertion coverage

### 4. **Performance Testing**
- Added performance benchmarks for critical operations
- Memory efficiency tests for large data handling
- Concurrent operation testing

### 5. **Security Testing**
- Verification that sensitive data is not persisted
- Content safety validation
- Input sanitization tests

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 17
- **Total Test Suites**: 6 major feature areas
- **Approximate Test Cases**: 200+ individual test cases
- **Key Features Tested**:
  - Authentication flows
  - AI story generation with streaming
  - Multi-model image generation
  - Interactive editing capabilities
  - Export to HTML/PPTX
  - State persistence and recovery

## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Run Specific Test Suite
```bash
npm test -- auth/authentication.test.js
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Environment Setup

The test suite uses:
- **Jest** as the test runner
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Mock Service Worker** patterns for API mocking
- **Custom test utilities** in `setupTests.js`

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. Some tests require `react-router-dom` which may need to be installed
2. Mock implementations for localStorage need refinement in some older tests
3. Canvas and image processing mocks could be enhanced

## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD to run tests on every commit
2. **Coverage Targets**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage
3. **E2E Tests**: Consider adding Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance regression tests
5. **Visual Regression**: Consider adding visual regression testing for UI components

## Conclusion

The optimized test suite provides comprehensive coverage of Tale Draw's functionality, ensuring reliability and maintainability. The tests are well-organized, efficient, and cover both functional requirements and edge cases. This foundation enables confident development and deployment of new features while maintaining quality.
